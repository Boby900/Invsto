# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
#### Hi there, welcome to my amazing project, I have used postgresql, python, pandas, numpy and matplotlib to build this project

## For starting the project
- first clone the project
- then install the dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- use this command in your terminal `python python_and_postgres.py` to run the project, when you are at the root directory.


## For running the test
- use this command `python -m unittest` in your root directory to run the test.
